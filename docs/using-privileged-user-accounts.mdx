**To use the Privileged Accounts feature, do the following:**

1. Make sure that you have Enterprise license activated.

2. [Configure the password vault](#_Password_Vault_Configuration).

**NOTE: You can use MS SQL Express for a password vault.**

3. On the **Configuration** page, **LDAP Target** tab, [define the administrator credentials](#_Defining_Domain_Administrator) for the domain in which shared accounts will be created. These credentials will be encrypted and saved to the password vault.

4. Select the **Enable jump server mode** option for the Client with the assigned Terminal Server license.

5. [Add a privileged user.](#_Adding_Privileged_User)

6. The shared account for access to the defined computer/computer group will be automatically created in the selected domain. Its credentials will be stored in the password vault in the encrypted format.

7. Now, the user can [work with the protected computers using the remote desktop connection under the created privileged user account](#_Using_Privileged_Account).
