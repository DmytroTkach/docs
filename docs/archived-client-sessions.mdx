During the [archiving & cleanup operation](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/display/DOC/Database+Management) all the old Client sessions are archived and then deleted from the current Ekran System database. This allows saving the monitored data in secure storage and viewing the archived sessions in the Session Viewer any time.
