You can monitor critical infrastructure for subcontractor access via a jump box server where subcontractors do not have access to production servers, but instead, need to connect via the jump box server (i.e. Windows Terminal Server).

For more information, please refer to the [Licensing Models](https://www.ekransystem.com/en/buy/licensing-scheme) available for Ekran System.
