**NOTE: A similar parameter is also available for Windows Clients and macOS Clients****.**

If the **Detect system IDLE events** checkbox is selected (on the **Editing Client** / **Editing Client Group** page, on the **Monitoring [Linux]** tab, in the **Monitoring Parameters** section at the top) to enable this option, an idle event is registered whenever the user is inactive for more than 15 minutes.
