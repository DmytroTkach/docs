If the [URL monitoring](#_URL_Monitoring_Parameters_3) option is enabled for the macOS Client, then each time the user activity is captured while the user is working in the browser, the URL address is saved and displayed in the URL column in the Metadata grid. If there are several records made while the user is viewing one page on a certain website, then all of them contain the same URL information.

The URL column contains only top and second-level domain names even if the parameter is not selected in the URL monitoring settings for the Windows Client. The full URL address is displayed in the Details pane.

**NOTE: As getting a URL address to be monitored may take about 600 milliseconds, there is a possibility that the screenshot and its activity title along with URL address may be not properly synchronized in the Session Viewer (e.g., the user may see a screenshot with a URL address that belongs to the previous one).**
