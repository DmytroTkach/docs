The **Role Type** permissions granted to users of secrets are displayed on the **Permissions** tab on the **Password Management**page in the Management Tool. The list of permissions is displayed in the form of grid which includes the following information in the corresponding columns:

**• User/Group Name:**The name of the user / user group of the secret to which the **Role Type** permissions are granted.

**• Secret Name:**The name of the secret for which the **Role Type** permissions are granted to the user / user group.

**• Secret Type:**The type of the secret for which the **Role Type** permissions are granted to the user / user group.

**• Permissions:**The **Role Type** permissions granted (**Owner**, **Editor**, or **PAM User**) to the user / user group of the secret.

**• Description:**The description of the secret for which the **Role Type** permissions are granted to the user / user group.

**To search for the required permissions**, type a search expression (i.e. keyword).

**To filter the information about the permissions in the grid**, use the filters:

**• Secret Name:**Allows filtering of the permissions by the specific name of a secret for which the permissions are granted.

**• User group**: Allows filtering of the permissions by a specific user group to whom the permissions are granted.

**• User**: Allows filtering of the permissions by a specific user to whom the permissions are granted.

**To sort the columns** in the grid, click the required column header. You can change the column sort order from ascending to descending, and vice versa by clicking the corresponding column header again. If the data is not sorted by a column, the **Sort** arrow is not shown in the column header.
