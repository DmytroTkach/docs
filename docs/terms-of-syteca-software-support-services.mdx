**2. Services**

Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, and conditioned on the Customer's compliance therewith, Syteca will provide services to the Customer as set out in this Section 2 (the "**Services**").

2.1. Scope of Services. During the term, Syteca will use commercially reasonable efforts to Resolve any Incidents reported by the Customer as follows:

a) Syteca will provide: (a) email and chat assistance in connection with the identification, diagnosis, and correction of Errors; and (b) access to technical information on the Provider's website for proper use of the Software;

b) Syteca, in its reasonable discretion, will determine the amount of time it will need to spend to attempt to Resolve any specific Incident;

c) Syteca will during Normal Business Hours initially provide first line support to the Customer to attempt to Resolve the reported Incident and subsequently provide such second and third line support as Syteca, in its reasonable discretion, deems necessary to attempt to Resolve the Incident.

2.2. Services SLA. Syteca shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide Responses and Resolutions within the following timeframes during Normal Business Hours **(“SLA Time”)**:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Incident Severity** | **Description** | **Response SLA Time** | **Resolution SLA Time** |
| Very High | An incident caused by the failure of the Software resulting in Customer’s inability to further operate it or potentially compromising user sensitive information. | 1 Business Day | 2 Business Days |
| High | An incident caused by the failure of important Software components, processes, or functions, which has a negative impact on the end-user experience, as well as causes material business impact. Other Software components and functions remain operational. | 1 Business Day | 7 Business Days |
| Medium | An incident resulting from the failure of some of the Software features, resulting in minor inconvenience to the end-user, but causing no material business impact. | 3 Business Days | 15 Business Days |
| Low | An incident requiring cosmetic changes to be made to the Software. | 5 Business Days | N/A |

Notes:

a) The Resolution SLA Time is paused for the time where Syteca is awaiting additional information requested from the Customer. If no response is received from the Customer after three contacts within a two-week period the Incident will be considered closed;

b) The Resolution SLA Time quoted is where the Resolution is completely under the control of Syteca. Where Syteca is reliant on an external supplier, additional time may be required to Resolve the Incident;

c) The Resolution SLA Time for Incidents is the target time to Resolve the Incident or for a workaround to be put in place. The workaround will reduce the Incident severity by restoring basic Software functions. A full Resolution will then be found as a matter of priority;

d) In extreme cases where an Incident, or group of Incidents, signifies an underlying Software problem and a workaround cannot be implemented within the Resolution SLA Time, the Customer will be informed and a workaround or Resolution will be implemented as a matter or priority.

2.3. Remote Services. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that Syteca may provide Services to the Customer remotely. The Customer agrees to provide Syteca with access to the Customer as necessary for Syteca to provide the Services to the Customer. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that Syteca may collect, maintain, process, and use certain diagnostic, technical, usage, and related information, including information about the Customer's computers, systems, network, relating to or derived from the Customer's use of Software in the course of performing the Services under these Terms. At all times, the Customer's information will be treated in accordance with Syteca's privacy policy, as amended from time to time, which can be viewed at **<https://www.syteca.com/en/privacy>** or a successor website address.

2.4. Optional Support Services. Syteca, in its sole discretion, may provide optional support services for Incidents which are out of scope of the Services hereunder to the Customer on the Customer's request, with Syteca's standard hourly rates then in effect.

2.5. Maintenance Releases. During the term, Syteca will provide the Customer with all Maintenance Releases and new Versions.

2.6. Service Changes. Syteca may, in its sole discretion, change any aspect of the Services or their performance on written, which includes email, notice to the Customer.

2.7. Subcontractors. Syteca may, in its sole discretion, perform any of the Services by or through third parties or any other Syteca Personnel.

**3. Limitations**

3.1. Incidents. Syteca has the sole right to determine, in its reasonable discretion: (a) what constitutes an Incident; and (b) when an Incident is deemed to be Resolved.

3.2. Response Time and Resolution. Syteca will make commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) Respond within the applicable Response SLA Time provided in Section 2; and (b) Resolve an Incident, within the applicable Resolution SLA Time provided in Section 2.2; but does not guarantee that it will be able to Respond within that specific time period or that any Incident will be Resolved.

3.3. Effect of Customer Failure or Delay. Syteca is not responsible or liable for any delay or failure of performance caused in whole or in part by any delay or failure to perform any of the Customer's obligations under these Terms (each, a "**Customer Failure**").

**4. Exceptions**

Syteca has no obligation to provide Services relating to Errors that, in whole or in part, arise out of or result from any of the following (each a "**Service Exception**"):

c) any Third-Party Materials;

d) any negligence, abuse, misapplication, or misuse of the Software other than by Syteca Personnel;

e) any Customer Failure, including the Customer's failure to promptly install any Maintenance Release that Syteca has previously made available to the Customer;

f) the operation of, or access to, the Customer's or a third party's system or network;

g) any Unsupported Software, beta software, software that Syteca makes available for testing or demonstration purposes, temporary software modules, or software for which Syteca does not receive a license fee;

All older Versions shall be considered **“Unsupported Versions”**.

**6. Intellectual Property Rights**

6.1. Intellectual Property Ownership. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that:

a) the Software and Deliverables are licensed, not sold, to the Customer by Syteca, and the Customer does not and will not have or acquire under or in connection with these Terms any ownership interest in the Software or Deliverables, or in any related intellectual property rights;

b) Syteca and its licensor(s) are and will remain the sole and exclusive owners of all rights, titles, and interest in, and to the Software and Deliverables, including all intellectual property rights relating thereto.

**7. Term and Termination**

7.1. The Customer, subject to payment by the Customer of the then current fee for Services, if any, shall be entitled to receive Services for the duration of the term of Software maintenance purchased. Thereafter, subject to the Customer’s obligation to pay the respective fees, the term of Software maintenance shall automatically renew for an additional twelve (12) month renewal terms unless either party notifies the other party of its intention not to renew at least thirty (30) days prior to expiry of the current term of Software maintenance. Syteca reserves the right to refuse renewal of Services, without cause, for any reason or no reason.

**8. Disclaimer of Warranties**

8.1. THE SERVICES AND THE DELIVERABLES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." SYTECA HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER (INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM THE COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE), AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THIS TERMS DOES NOT AMEND, AUGMENT, OR OTHERWISE MODIFY SYTECA'S WARRANTIES UNDER THE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT OR ANY CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, OR RESTRICTIONS THEREOF.

**9. Service Credit**

9.1. In the case of Syteca failing to meet the SLA Time for any Incident, the Customer will be eligible for a service credit **("Service Credit")**, provided that the Customer reports to Syteca such a failure to meet the SLA Time and requests such Service Credit in accordance with this Section 9. The amount of any Service Credit hereunder shall be calculated as follows: Service Credit = X \* Y \* 2%, where X = the total fees paid by the Customer for the affected Services for the relevant calendar month (regardless of when billed or payable), and Y = the number of days of delay in meeting the SLA Time.. In any given year of Services, Service Credit shall not exceed 20% of the total fees paid by the Customer for the Services in that year. Service Credit is only redeemable for further purchase of Services renewals.

9.2. To receive Service Credit, the Customer must submit a claim by emailing Syteca at **[sales@syteca.com](mailto:sales@syteca.com)**. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by Syteca by the end of the month following the month where the SLA Time was not met and must include: (i) the words “Support SLA Credit Request” in the subject line; (ii) the dates when the SLA Time was not met that; (iii) the Customer name; and (iv) relevant Services ticket number(s). Once such a request is validated, Syteca will notify the Customer of the issuance of Service Credit. The Customer’s failure to provide the request and information as required above will disqualify the Customer from receiving Service Credit.

9.3. The Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any Syteca failure to meet the SLA Time is the receipt of Service Credit (if eligible) in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms.

9.4. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SYTECA BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY CUSTOMER AS A RESULT OF SYTECA’S FAILURE TO MEET THE SLA TIME, HOWSOEVER CAUSED. THE CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR SUCH A FAILURE IS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 9.

**10. Export Regulation**

The Software may be subject to US export control laws, including the Export Control Reform Act and its associated regulations. The Customer will not directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Software to, or make the Software accessible from, any country, jurisdiction, or person to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by applicable law. The Customer will comply with all applicable laws and complete all the required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval) prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Software available outside the US.

**11. Entire Terms**

These Terms, together with the software license agreement into which these Terms are incorporated by reference, constitute the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements made in these Terms and the software license agreement, the following order of precedence governs: (a) first, the software license agreement; (b) second, these Terms.
