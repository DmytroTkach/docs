A user starts playing macOS Session by clicking the required Session in the Client Sessions list. The session is opened in the new tab or new window depending on the browser settings. While playing macOS sessions, you can view screenshots in the **Player** pane and associated metadata (Application name, Activity title, URL, etc.) in the Metadata grid.
