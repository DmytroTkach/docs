In case, the one-time password has been generated for the wrong user or sent to the wrong email address, you can terminate it manually.

**To terminate a one-time password manually, do the following:**

1.Â Log in to the Management Tool as a user with the [Client configuration management permission](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/display/DOC/Client+Permissions).

2. Click the **Access Management** navigation link to the left.

3. On the **Access Management** page, open the **One-time Passwords** tab.

4. On the **One-time Passwords** tab, click the **Expire** link for the target one-time password.

**NOTE: You can manually terminate the one-time passwords with the Generated & Sent or Sending Failed states only.**

5. In the confirmation message, click **OK**.

6. The state of the one-time password changes to **Manually Expired** and the user will not be able to use it.
