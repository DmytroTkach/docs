BlueNot available in SaaS

By default, Ekran System is installed in Single-Tenant mode, so that all Clients and settings can be shared among all users according to their permissions.

If required, Ekran System can instead be used in Multi-Tenant mode, where all tenant users only have access to the Clients within their own tenant, and do not have access to other tenantsâ€™ Clients, configurations, alerts, reports, etc.

Multi-Tenant mode is available for Windows, macOS and Linux Clients. For macOS Clients and Linux Clients, the tenant they belong to is defined during **Client installation**.

**NOTE: This feature is** **only available with an activated serial key for** **the Enterprise Edition of Ekran System****.**
