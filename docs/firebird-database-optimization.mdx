When using the Firebird database, it is recommended to perform the **Update statistics** procedure at least every two months in order to optimize the database and increase the speed of reports generation.

**To perform the Update statistics procedure, do the following:**

1. Log in to the Management Tool as a user with the administrative [Database management permission](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/display/DOC/Administrative+Permissions).
2. Click the **Configuration** navigation link to the left.
3. On the **Database Management** tab, click **Update statistics** at the bottom of the page.
