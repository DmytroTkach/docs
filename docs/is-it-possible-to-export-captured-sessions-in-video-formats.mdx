Yes, [a session (or session fragment) can be exported](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/view/user-manual/forensic-export)Â in encrypted form for viewing on any computer, even without access to the Management Tool.

A session is exported into a signed executable file, and an embedded player is used to display the graphical information (i.e. screen captures) and metadata.
