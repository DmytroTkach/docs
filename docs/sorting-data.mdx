**To sort the metadata in the Metadata grid**, click the required column header.

You can also change the column sort order from ascending to descending, and vice versa by clicking the **Sort** arrow in the corresponding column header on the right.

**NOTE: If the data is not sorted by a column, the Sort arrow is not shown in the column header.**
