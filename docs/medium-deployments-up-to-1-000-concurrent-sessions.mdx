**The Application Server:**

• CPU: 8-16 cores

• RAM: 8-16 GB

• It is recommended to deploy Ekran System in High Availability mode using a Microsoft failover cluster.

**The database:**

• CPU: 8-16 cores

• RAM: 24-32 GB

• It is recommended to store binary data in a shared or local folder.

• [**If binary data is stored in a shared or local folder**] Operating System hard disk: 100-200 GB (15K or SSD).

• It is highly recommended to configure an SQL Server failover cluster.

**Bandwidth:**

• A 1 Gbps Ethernet adapter (a 10 Gbps Ethernet adapter is recommended).

**The Management Tool:**

• CPU: 4-8 cores

• RAM: 4 GB

• A 1 Gbps Ethernet adapter

• It is recommended to install the Management Tool on a separate computer.

**Capacity per month  **(for 1,000 Client sessions)**:**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Full-Day Activity (24/7)** | **40-Hour Working Week, 24 Work Days per Month** |
| **Default Settings** | **27 TB** | **7 TB** |
| The values stated above are equivalent to: 1 Client session generates an **average of approx. 300 MB per 8-hour day**, or just **37 MB per hour**) | |

****NOTE: T**he amount of data sent to the Application Server can be reduced in a variety of ways ******on the Client computers******, such as by changing the default settings of the Windows Clients or macOS Clients (e.g. the user activity recording, monitoring, and filtering parameters) to only record user activity on the Client computers under certain conditions**, and for Linux Clients******** **by defining separate function calls or command output to be skipped or limited while monitoring. **On Windows Clients, various additional options (Bandwidth Usage Reduction Parameters) can also be used to reduce the amount of data that the Client records and sends to the Application Server.****
