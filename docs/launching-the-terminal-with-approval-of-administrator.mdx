**The process of** **logging into the Client computer with the approval of the administrator is performed as follows:**

1. The user logs in to the Linux computer with installed Client in a common way.
2. If [Forced User Authentication](#_Forced_User_Authentication_3) is enabled, the user enters their secondary credentials.
3. An email with the request is sent to the defined email address. The administrator receives an email with the request.
4. In the received email, the administrator clicks the **Grant access** hyperlink to allow the user to log in.

If the user is not allowed to log in, the administrator clicks the **Block access** hyperlink and the user is logged out.
