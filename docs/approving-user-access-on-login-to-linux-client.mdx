**To ensure that particular users are able to log into the Linux Client computers only after the additional approval, do the following**:

1. [Define the administrator’s email address](#_Defining_Email_Address) (one or several), to which the access requests will be sent.
2. [Define the list of the restricted users](#_Managing_Restricted_User) required to get the administrator’s approval. The users will be required to get approval when logging into all Client computers.
3. In the email sent to the defined address, grant or forbid the user the access to the Client computer.
