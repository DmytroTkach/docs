The Granting User Access on Schedule feature allows you to better protect the Client computers from access at undesired time. You can create a list of users whose access to the Client computers will be granted only for a certain period of time out of which the administratorâ€™s approval on login will be required.

Please note when monitoring of graphical interface for X Window System is enabled, the Granting User Access on Schedule feature is available only for sessions started via the remote SSH terminal.

**NOTE: The Granting User Access on Schedule feature** **is available only if you have an activated** [**Enterprise serial key**](#_General_Licensing_Information)**.**
