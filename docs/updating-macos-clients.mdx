An automatic update of the Client is performed as soon as a macOS Client connects to the Application Server whenever a newer version of the Application Server is installed.

After a macOS Client is updated, you will still be able to access the monitored data received before it was updated.

**NOTE: It may not be possible to update** **macOS** **Clients of very old versions, in which case the ClientsÂ need to reinstalled.**
