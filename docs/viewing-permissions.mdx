The permissions assigned are displayed on the **Permissions** tab on the **Password Management**page in the Management Tool. The list of permissions is displayed in the form of grid which includes the following information in the corresponding columns:

**- User/Group Name:**The name of the user or user group to which the permission is granted.

**- Secret Name:**The name of the secret for which the permission is granted.

**- Secret Type:**The type of the corresponding secret.

**- Permission:**The type of permission granted (Owner, Editor, or PAM User).

**- Description:**The description of the secret.

You can search for the required permission using a search expression (i.e. keyword).

You can also filter and sort the information about the permissions in the grid.

By default, the following filters are displayed:

**- Who**: Allows filtering of the permissions by a specific user or user group to whom the permission is granted.

**- Secret Name:**Allows filtering of the permissions by a specific name of a secret for which the permission is granted.

To sort the permissions on the **Permissions** tab (on the **Password Management**page), click the required column header. You can change the column sort order from ascending to descending, and vice versa. To do this, click the **Sort** arrow in the corresponding column header on the right. If the data is not sorted by a column, the **Sort** arrow is not shown in the column header.
