Ekran System allows you to enable the keystroke logging which helps to detect malicious insiders and protect your sensitive data on the end-points. In addition, to get information only on the suspicious activities, you can enable the recording of the user activity started automatically on detecting a specific keyword in typed keystrokes.

To ensure the GDPR compliance, all logged keystrokes are hidden in the Session Viewer and the reports, but you can perform searches within them and create alerts to be triggered when specific words are typed.

If you want to enable the keystroke displaying in the Session Viewer and the reports, contact us at Â <https://www.ekransystem.com/en/support/contact-support> or send an email to [support@ekransystem.com](mailto:support@ekransystem.com)

The logged keystrokes are encrypted in the MS SQL database and the PostgreSQL database by the unique Ekran Master Certificate which is generated on installation. So, in case anybody has direct access to the database, they will not be able to review logged keystrokes.
