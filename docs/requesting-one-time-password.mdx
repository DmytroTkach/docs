While logging into the Client computer with the enabled [forced user authentication](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/display/DOC/Forced+User+Authentication+Parameter) and a one-time password option, the user can request a one-time password to get temporary access to the Client computer, as follows:

1. In the secondary authentication window, the user clicks **Request Password**.

2 In the opened **Request Password** window, the user enters their email address and then, optionally, enters a comment to be displayed to the administrator.

3. The user clicks **Request**.

4. The request is sent to the Ekran System administrators’ email addresses defined for the Client while [turning on the one-time password option](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/display/DOC/Enabling+Forced+User+Authentication+on+Windows+Client).

5. The administrator will generate a one-time password and the generated password will be sent to the email address defined in the **Request Password** window.

6. In a while, the user checks the email box for an email with the generated password. In case the email with the generated password has not been received, the user can request it again.

**NOTE: The one-time password for logging into the same Client computer cannot be requested more often than once per hour.**

The received one-time password can be used only once during 24 hours since its generation and only for logging into the Client computer from which it has been requested. If the user does not use a one-time password for 24 hours, it automatically expires.
