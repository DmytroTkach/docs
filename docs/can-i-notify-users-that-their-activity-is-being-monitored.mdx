You can [enable the displaying of the additional message](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/view/user-manual/windows-clients/informing-users-about-monitoring/enabling-the-displaying-of-an-additional-message) on user login to inform users that their actions are being monitored and notify them about corporate policies or the laws of the country.

You can also [enable the displaying of the Client tray icon](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/view/user-manual/windows-clients/informing-users-about-monitoring/enabling-the-displaying-of-the-client-tray-icon) in the Client system tray, which displays a notification informing the user that the Client is being monitored.
