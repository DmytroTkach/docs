Forensic Export allows exporting the session in the encrypted form for viewing monitored session and analyzing recorded audio data on any computer, even without access to the Management Tool. The session is exported into the signed executable file, which contains the embedded player for displaying graphical information and metadata. The validity of forensic export results can be checked via the Management Tool. The results of export are stored on the Server until you delete them.
