Ekran System includes the following components:

**- The Ekran System Application Server (further referred to as the Application Server or the Server)**: This is the main component of Ekran System and is used for storing the screen captures and associated information received from the Clients. The operation of the Application Server can be started or stopped by way of the **Server Tray** icon.

**- The Ekran System Management Tool (further referred to as the Management Tool):** This is the central administrative unit that allows you to control and manage Clients, users, USB monitoring rules, alerts, the Application Server database, serial keys, etc. You can access the Management Tool from any computer in the network without having to install it on that computer.

**- The Ekran System Session Viewer**: This component provides a user-friendly interface for quick review of the monitored data received from Ekran System Clients.

**- Ekran System Windows Clients (further referred to as Windows Clients):** Being hosted on remote computers, Windows Clients record screen captures at the defined frequency and send them to the Application Server along with metadata such as user name, host name, activity times, active window titles, application names, URLs, clipboard text data, keystrokes, etc. Managing the configuration and settings of the remote Windows Clients is performed by using the Management Tool.

**- Ekran System macOS Clients (further referred to as macOS Clients):** Being hosted on remote computers, macOS Clients record screen captures at the defined frequency and send them to the Application Server along with metadata such as user name, host name, activity times, active window titles, application names, etc. Managing the configuration and settings of the remote macOS Clients is performed by using the Management Tool.

**- Ekran System Linux/Unix Clients (further referred to as Linux Clients):** Being hosted on remote computers, Linux Clients capture input/output terminal data (including all commands executed) and send this interactive data to the Application Server.

**- The Ekran System Tray Notifications application (further referred to as the Tray Notifications application):** This application allows notifications to be received about Client alert events.
