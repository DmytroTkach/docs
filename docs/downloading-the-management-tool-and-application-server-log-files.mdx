The log files contain information that might be useful to administrators for detecting any problems with the system.

You can either analyze the log files yourself to get more information on what is happening in your system, or send them to the Support team to help them in detecting the source of any problems with your system.

**To download the Management Tool log and the Application Server log files**, click the **Health Monitoring** navigation link on the left, and then click the  icon next to the **System State** tab on the right, and select **Download Log Files (MT and Server)** in the drop-down list. In the **Save As** window, browse to the location where you want the log file to be saved, and click **Save**. The log file will then be downloaded to your computer.

**NOTE: Every time the Application Server restarts, a new Application Server log file is created. The current Application Server log file can be downloaded by way of the Management Tool, and can also be found along with older log files in the folder: C:\Program Files\Ekran System\Ekran System: C:\Program Files\Ekran System\Ekran System\ServerLogs**
