A new version of Ekran System Application Server is installed manually, over the top of any previous version. All configurations remain the same.

After you update the Ekran System Application Server, Ekran System Clients will be updated automatically.

For further details, please see Updating the System Overview (Checklist & Best Practice).

**NOTE: You will receive a reminder about the expiration of your Ekran System Update & Support period in advance, so that you can renew your subscription in time, and continue having access to new releases.**
