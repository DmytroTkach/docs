Upon purchasing any license for Ekran System software, the customer becomes eligible for support and maintenance services. All support and maintenance will be provided with accordance to the following policy:

Support and maintenance period
------------------------------

Support and maintenance for Ekran System are provided for a period of one year (365 days) starting with the moment the license is activated. Over the period of a year, the customer receives access to every new release, as well as the ability to contact our support staff regarding any issues covered by our support in accordance with this policy.

Issues, covered by technical support
------------------------------------

Our technical support service covers any issues regarding installation, update, operation or uninstallation of Ekran System software and any of its components. Technical support does not cover issues regarding customer hardware or network infrastructure, as well as any issues that can arise when running Ekran System on an end-point with an unsupported OS or when minimal system requirements for stable operation of Ekran System are not met.

Support for prior releases
--------------------------

Prior releases of Ekran System are not supported. Technical support is provided only for the latest official release of the software. For the duration of support and maintenance period, Informational support, including consultancy and answers to questions regarding the product and its operation can be provided for all prior releases, but in order to receive any updates, customers need to have the latest official minor version of Ekran System installed. An ability to update any prior release to the latest official minor version of the system is provided for the duration of the support and maintenance period.

Contacting support service
--------------------------

Ekran System support service can be contacted via e-mail at [support@ekransystem.com](mailto:support@ekransystem.com). A message should provide a detailed description of a problem with log files attached if possible. Upon receiving an e-mail, our technical specialist is obliged to contact the customer back within the next 24 hours.

Attaching a log file to an e-mail detailing the issue
-----------------------------------------------------

If possible, a log file should be attached to an e-mail detailing the issue, addressed at our support team. In order to get such files, you can download our Log Collector tools for Ekran System Client and Ekran System Server via the links below. Upon running these tools, necessary log files will be generated on desktops of the corresponding endpoints.

Ending and renewal of maintenance period
----------------------------------------

Support and maintenance are no longer provided after the end of the initial support and maintenance period (1 year since the moment of license activation), unless the service is renewed. Support and maintenance service can be renewed for an additional fee derived from the sum of the initial purchase. If the customer wishes to renew support and maintenance services, they need to contact their local representative or Ekran System vendor directly.

End of life policy
------------------

In case decision to discontinue further development of Ekran System product is made, all current customers will be notified half a year before further development efforts will be stopped. After that, technical support will continue for another half a year, therefore providing every customer with a full year of technical support and maintenance.
