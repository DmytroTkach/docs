Keystroke logging allows keystrokes input by a user on a Linux Client in to be monitored SSH sessions by creating an alert for a specific keyword.

**NOTE: This feature is not enabled by default, and is only available after adding the <add key="**EnableLinuxUserInputMonitoring**" value="1" /> key to the EkranServer.Settings.config file. The .config file can be found in the C:\Program Files\Ekran System\Ekran System\Server folder on the computer where the Application Server is installed.**

If the **Enable keystroke logging** checkbox is selected (on the **Editing Client** / **Editing Client Group** page, on the **Keystroke Monitoring** tab, in the **Monitoring Parameters** section (at the top) to enable this option, the Linux Client in SSH sessions logs the user’s keystrokes.
