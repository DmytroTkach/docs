**To perform a forensic export of selected Client sessions**, open the **Monitoring Results** page, and on the **Client Sessions** tab that opens, select the checkboxes next to the required sessions (in the left-hand column in the grid), then click the **Bulk Action** () button (in the top left), and select **Forensic Export** in the drop-down menu that opens.

In the **Sessions Forensic Export** pop-up window that opens, click **Export**.

Optionally, to protect the exported sessions file to be generated with a password, select the **Protect with password** checkbox, and enter a password into the **Password** and **Confirm password** fields, before clicking **Export**.

The **Forensic Export History** page then opens, displaying the export progress.

As soon as the export process finishes, the resulting files are available for downloading on the **Forensic Export History** page that opens. Click the **Download** ()icon to download the required file with the results of the **Forensic Export**.

**To play the exported sessions**, the Ekran Forensic Player needs to be downloaded (by using the link at the top of the **Forensic Export History** page).
