• CPU: 4-8 cores

• RAM: 8-16 GB

**The database:**

• CPU: 4-8 cores

• RAM: 16 GB

| --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Full-Day Activity (24/7)** | **40-Hour Working Week, 24 Work Days per Month** |
| **Default Settings** | **5.25 TB** | **1.4 TB** |
| The values stated above are equivalent to: 1 Client session generates an **average of approx. 300 MB per 8-hour day**, or just **37 MB per hour**) | |

****NOTE: T**he amount of data sent to the Application Server can be reduced in a variety of ways, such as by changing the default settings of the Windows Clients or macOS Clients (e.g. the user activity recording, monitoring, and filtering parameters) to only record user activity on the Client computers under certain conditions**, and for Linux Clients also**********by defining separate function calls or command output to be skipped or limited while monitoring.**
