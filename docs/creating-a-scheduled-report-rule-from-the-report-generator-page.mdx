Once the parameters for the report are defined, you can create a [scheduled report rule](#_Report_Rules) basing on the defined parameters.

**To create a rule, do the following:**

1. Log in to the Management Tool as a user with the [Viewing monitoring results](#_Client_Permissions) permission.

2. Click the **Report Generator** navigation link to the left.

3. Define the [report parameters](#_About_5).

4. In the **Report Generator** drop-down menu, click **Create Scheduled Report Rule**.

5. The **Editing Rule** page opens.

6. On the **Rule Properties** tab, enter a unique name for the created rule and then optionally enter its description. The default name of the rule is **GeneratorRule<number of rule>**.

7. Click **Next**.

8. On the **Report Options** tab, enter the corresponding values in the **Report Parameters** fields and the **Emails** field the same as when [adding a new report rule](#_Adding_Report_Rules). The other parameters like **Report Type**, **Clients**, and **Users** were defined in Report Generator, but you can edit them if you want.

9. Click **Finish**.
