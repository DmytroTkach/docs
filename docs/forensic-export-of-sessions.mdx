To perform forensic export of all filtered out sessions, click Â next to the **Client Sessions** tab, point to **Export filtered sessions**, and then click **Forensic Export**.

In the **Sessions Forensic Export** window, in the **Export type** drop-down list, select one of the following:

* **Session with audio:** To export monitored sessions with the recorded audio data. Please note that the audio data will be exported only for the Clients with the enabled **Enable audio recording** option.
* **Session without audio:** To export monitored sessions without the recorded audio data.
* **Audio only:** To export only the recorded audio data associated with the filtered sessions. Please note that the audio data will be exported only for the Clients with the enabled **Enable audio recording** option.

**NOTE: Microsoft Media Foundation must be installed on the computer with the Ekran System Server to export only the recorded audio data associated with the sessions. On Windows Server 2008 R2, Desktop Experience must be installed.**

If you want to protect exported sessions with a password, select the **Protect with password** option and enter the password in the **Password** and **Confirm password** boxes, and then click **Export.** The **Forensic Export History** page opens, displaying the export progress.
