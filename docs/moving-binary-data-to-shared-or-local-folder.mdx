If necessary, you can store binary data received from Clients in the shared or local folder on your computer.Â  This might be necessary for storing large amounts of data.

This feature has the following limitations:

* Shared Folders on mapped and mounted disks cannot be used for storing binary data.
* After you select to store binary data in the shared folder instead of MS SQL database, the already existing screenshots will no longer be displayed (only [metadata](https://documentation.ekransystem.com/display/DOC/Metadata+Grid) will be available for them). The newly received screenshots will be displayed.

**To move binary data to the shared folder,** **do the following**:

1. Stop the Server by clicking Stop in the context menu of the Server icon in the notification area or find the **EkranServer** service in the Task Manager and click **Stop**.

2. For the Firebird database, do the following (for the MS SQL database, skip this step):

* Open the Windows Registry Editor.
* In the **Registry Editor** window, select the HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\EkranSystem key.
* Find the Database value and check where the Database files are located on your computer.
* Move the Cache folder with binary file to a new location.

3. In the **Registry Editor** window, click Edit > New > String value and add a new value:

* Value type: String
* Value name: StorageDirectory
* Value data: Shared Folder location as \\<computer IP>\<folder path> or \\<computer name>\<folder path>

4. To access binary data in the shared folder on a different computer from your Server, it is recommended to do the following:

* Open **Computer Management**.
* In the Computer Management window, open **Services and Applications > Services**.
* In the Services pane, find the **EkranServer** service and select **Properties** in the context menu.
* In the **EkranServer Properties** window navigate to the **Log On** tab.
* In the Log On tab, select the **This account** option, specify the credentials for the EkranServer service to start under, and click **Apply**. Make sure the user with the specified credentials has administrator permissions on your Server computer and full access to the shared folder on the different computer.
* Restart the service.

5. Start the **EkranServer** service to continue working with the program.
