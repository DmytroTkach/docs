Clipboard monitoring allows you to monitor **Cut**, **Copy**, and **Paste** operations performed on the Client computer.

If the **Enable clipboard monitoring** checkbox is selected (on the **Editing Client** / **Editing Client Group** page, on the **Monitoring[Windows/macOS]** tab, in the **Monitoring Parameters** section at the top) to enable this option, the Client will log the text data which is copied or cut, and then pasted, either by using context menu commands or such shortcut key combinations as **Ctrl+C**, **Ctrl+Ins**, **Ctrl+X**, **Shift+Del**.

The logged text data is displayed in the **Text Data** column in the Session Viewer (in the Metadata grid). For more information, see .
